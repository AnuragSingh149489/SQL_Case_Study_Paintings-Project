# SQL_Case_Study_Paintings-Project

An SQL Case study in which I will download a dataset from Kaggle and then upload it to a PostgreSQL database using Python. I then analyzed the data and solve 20+ SQL queries. The aim is to provide a dataset to analyze data and then practice basic to intermediate SQL problems. I used a simple Python script to upload data from CSV files to PostgreSQL database tables. I then used SQL queries to answer over 20+ problems related to the paintings dataset.
